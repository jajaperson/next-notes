This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## To Do
* [ ] Setup basic markdown rendering
    * [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark); [useful demo for dynamic routes and md rendering](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/dynamic-routes/render-markdown)
* [ ] Find/implement a latex renderer
    * [KaTeX looks good](https://katex.org/) 
* [ ] Implement link preview 
* [ ] Solve the backlinks problem
* [ ] Come up with a solution for hashtags 
    * Write .ts for a full vault search 
#### Fancy stuff
* [ ] Implement graph view (with physics and coloured paths for clusters/coloured nodes for nodes with specific attributes)
* [ ] Optimise hashtags and backlinks
* [ ] Shortest paths e.g. Dijkstra's 
* [ ] Find if two arbitrary notes are related via union-find (implement disjoint set union data structure (with path compression and all the other bells and whistles)) - use this to colour specific clusters
