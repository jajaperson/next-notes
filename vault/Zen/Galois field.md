# Galois field

A **Galois field** is a field containing a finite number of elements. #m/def/ring
The [cardinality](Cardinality.md) of a field is called its **order**,
and finite fields **only exist** for orders of the form $p^h$ where $p$ is prime.
The Galois field of order $p^h$, **unique** up to isomorphism, is denoted $\mathrm{GF}(p^h)$. #m/thm/ring

## Constructing a field

A finite field of a given order can be constructed as a [quotient of a polynomial ring](Polynomial%20ring.md#congruences-and-quotients).
Given a polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]$
and an irreducible polynomial $f$ of degree $h$,
then $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x] / {\equiv}_{f}$ uniquely defines the field of degree $p^h$ up to isomorphism. #m/thm/ring
