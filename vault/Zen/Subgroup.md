[Group theory MOC](Group%20theory%20MOC.md)

# Subgroup

A **subgroup** is a subset of a [group](Group.md) $H \sube G$ such that $H$ is a group under the same operations #m/def/group ,
i.e. $H$ is

* closed under the group operation
* contains the inverse of every element

## Tests for subgroups

Let $G$ be a group and $H \sube G$ be a nonempty subset.
Additionally we define predicate $p$ so that $H = \{ x \in G \mid p(x) \}$.
The following hold:[^gallian]

### One step subgroup test

**Theorem.** Iff $ab^{-1} \in H$ whenever $a,b \in H$, then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. #m/thm/group

 > 
 > \[!check\]- Proof
 > Since $H$ is nonempty there exists $x \in H$, then with $a = b = x$ clearly $e \in H$,
 > $H$ must be closed under inversion, since letting $a=e$ for any $b \in H$ we have $eb^{-1} = b^{-1} \in H$.
 > Now we can show that $H$ is closed in general:
 > For any $a,b \in H$ we have $b^{-1} \in H$ and therefore $ab = a(b^{-1})^{-1} \in H$. <span class="QED"/>

 > \[!info\]- Application
 > 
 > 1. Show $p(e)$
 > 1. Assume $p(a)$ and $p(b)$
 > 1. Prove $p(ab^{-1})$

### Two step subgroup test

**Theorem.** Iff $H$ is closed under the binary operation and under the inverse,
then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. #m/thm/group

 > 
 > \[!check\]- Proof
 > Since $H$ is nonempty there exists $x$ in $H$, thus $x^{-1} \in H$ and thus $e = x x^{-1} \in H$.
 > Thence $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. <span class="QED"/>

 > 
 > \[!info\]- Application
 > Much the same as [above](Subgroup.md#one-step-subgroup-test), but with
 > 
 > 3. Prove $p(a^{-1})$ and $p(ab)$.

### Finite subgroup test

**Theorem.** $H$ is finite and closed under the binary operation, then it is a subgroup of $G$. #m/thm/group

 > 
 > \[!check\]- Proof
 > Take any $x \in H$.
 > Since $H$ is closed we may construct a sequence $(x^n)_{n=1}^\infty \in H$.
 > Since $H$ is finite, by the *Pigeonhole principle* the sequence must have repeated elements,
 > so that for some $1<i<j$ we have $x^i = x^j$.
 > Then $a^{i-j} = e$ and hence $a a^{i-j-1} = e$,
 > so $a^{-1} = a^{i-j-1} \in H$.
 > Therefore $H$ is closed under the inverse and the binary operation,
 > and is thus a subgroup of $G$ by the [Two step subgroup test](Subgroup.md#two-step-subgroup-test). <span class="QED"/>

## Examples of subgroups

* For any element $a \in G$ we can generate a [Cyclic subgroup](Cyclic%20subgroup.md) $\langle a \rangle = \{ \dots, a^{-2}, a^{-1}, e, a, a^2, \dots \}$.
* The [Centre of a group](Centre%20of%20a%20group.md) is a subgroup containing elements that commute with all elements.
* Similarly the [Centralizer of a group element](Centralizer%20of%20a%20group%20element.md) is a subgroup containing elements that commute with a given element.
* [Torsion subgroup of an abelian group](Torsion%20subgroup%20of%20an%20abelian%20group.md)
* [The order of a subgroup divides the order of a group](Lagrange's%20Theorem.md)

## Properties

* [The intersection of subgroups is a subgroup](The%20intersection%20of%20subgroups%20is%20a%20subgroup.md)
* Subgroups may be [Conjugate subgroups](Conjugate%20subgroups.md) if they can be derived from each other by conjugation.
  A subgroup with no other conjugate subgroups is called a [Normal subgroup](Normal%20subgroup.md).
