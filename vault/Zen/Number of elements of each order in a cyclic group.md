# Number of elements of each order in a cyclic group

Let $\langle a \rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order $n$, and $d$ be a positive divisor of $n$.
Then there exist exactly $\phi(n)$ elements in $\langle a \rangle$ of order $d$,
where $\phi$ is the [Euler totient function](Euler%20totient%20function.md). #m/thm/group

Significantly, there is no dependence on $n$, and hence $\mathbb{Z}_{73}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ both have exactly $\phi(8) = 4$ elements of order 8.
