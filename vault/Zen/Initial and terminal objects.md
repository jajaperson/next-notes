# Initial and Terminal Objects

**Initial** and **terminal objects** are objects within a category which, if they exist, are unique up to isomorphism.
Loosely speaking, all objects ‘flow’ from the initial object and to the terminal object.
More precisely, in a category $\cat C$, objects $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ are called the initial and terminal objects respectively if for any object $X$ there exist unique morphisms $I \in \cat C(\mathbf{0}, X)$ and $T \in \cat C(X, \mathbf{1})$. #m/def/cat
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{0} \xrightarrow{\quad I\ \quad} X \xrightarrow{\quad T\ \quad} \mathbf{1}
\end{align*}
$$
Concisely, $\cat C(\mathbf{0},-)$ and $\cat C(-,\mathbf{1})$ always contain exactly one morphism.

## As limits and colimits

Formulated as [Limits and colimits](Limits%20and%20colimits.md), the terminal object is the limit of the [Empty diagram](Empty%20diagram.md) and the initial object is its colimit.

## Examples

### In a [Poset](Poset.md)

The simplest example is perhaps in posets, viewed as categories, in which the initial and terminal objects represent the smallest and largest values respectively.

### In *Set* and [Top](Category%20of%20topological%20spaces.md)

In the category $\Set$, it is required that a unique morphism exists mapping the empty set $\emptyset$ for every set $A$.
Hence $\emptyset$ is the initial object.

In a similar fashion, it is clear that one and only one mapping exists from each set to a singleton set $\set *$,
and that all singletons are isomorphic.
Hence the singleton is the terminal object.

### In [Hask](Hask.md)

Analogously, in $\Hask$, the initial object is the `Void` type

````haskell
absurd :: Void -> a
````

While the terminal object is the canonical singleton type `()`

````haskell
unit :: a -> ()
unit _ = ()
````

### In [Vect](Category%20of%20vector%20spaces.md)

In $\Vect_\mathbb{K}$, both the initial and terminal object, hence the zero object,
is the *trivial vector space* $O$.
Clearly, all trivial vector spaces are isomorphic
(e.g. the trivial subspace of $\mathbb R^2$ and $\mathbb R^3$).
For any vector space $V \in \Ob(\Vect_{\mathbb{K}})$,
there exists exactly one linear transformation $f \in \Vect_{\mathbb K}(V, \{ \vab 0 \})$,
and this is also clearly epic.
$$
\begin{align*}
f &: V \rightarrowtail O \\
&: v \mapsto \vab 0
\end{align*}
$$
Likewise, there exists exactly one (monic) linear transformation $g \in \Vect_{\mathbb K}(\{ \vab 0 \}, V)$
$$
\begin{align*}
g &: O \twoheadrightarrow V \\
&: \vab 0 \to \vab 0
\end{align*}
$$
and we therefore have $f \circ g = \id_{O}$

### In [Grp](Category%20of%20groups.md)

The trivial group $\{ e \}$ is both the initial and terminal object.
