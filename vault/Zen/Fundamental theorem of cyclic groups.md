# Fundamental theorem of cyclic groups

 > 
 > Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
 > Moreover, if $\abs{\langle a \rangle} = n$ then the order of any subgroup of $\langle a \rangle$ is a divisor of $n$;
 > and, for each positive divisor $k$ of $n$, the group $\langle a \rangle$ has exactly one subgroup of order $k$, namely $\langle a^{n/k} \rangle$.[^2017] #m/thm/group

The first part of this theorem is clearly the only that may be applied to infinite cyclic groups.

## Corollary for modular arithmetic

For each positive divisor $k$ of $n$ the unique subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ of order $k$ is $\langle k / n \rangle$.
