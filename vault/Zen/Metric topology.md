# Metric topology

A **metric topology** is a topology formed on a [Metric space](Metric%20space.md) $(M, d)$,
using [open balls](Open%20ball.md) as a [topological basis](Topological%20basis.md).

Given an arbitrary topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$,
if there exists a [metric](Metric%20space.md) $d: X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$
that forms a metric space equivalent to $\mathcal{T}$,
then the topological space $X$ is said to be **metrizable**.

## Open and closed sets

For a metric space $(M, d)$, a subset $S \sube M$ is called **open** iff
for every point $s \in S$, there exists some $\delta > 0$ such that the [Open ball](Open%20ball.md) $B_{\delta}(s) \in S$.
In other words, $S$ is a [Neighbourhood](Neighbourhood.md) of every $s \in S$:
one can move in any direction from a point $s \in S$ without leaving $S$.

As is always the case with a topological space, a set is called **closed** iff its compliment is open. See also [Sequential closedness](Sequential%20closedness.md).

Loosely speaking, in the standard euclidean metric space $(\mathbb{R}^3, d)$, a set is open iff it does not include its boundary,
while it is closed iff it does.

Outside of the trivial clopen sets $X$ and $\0$, **clopen** sets can occur in metric spaces
when the [boundary](Boundary.md) of a subset is not included in the space.
For example, in the metric space $(\mathbb{Q}, d)$ with standard metric,
the set $\{ x \in \mathbb{Q} \mid x ^2 < 3 \}$ is **clopen** since the boundary $\pm \sqrt{ 3 } \notin \mathbb{Q}$.
A topology in which all sets are **clopen** is defined by the [discrete metric](Discrete%20topology.md).

### Basic properties

Since a metric topology forms a [topological space](Topological%20space.md),

* the (in)finite union of open sets is open.
* the finite union of closed sets is closed.
* the finite intersection of open sets is open.
* the (in)finite intersection of closed sets is closed.

## Properties

* [Metrizable implies Hausdorff](Metrizable%20implies%20Hausdorff.md) (see [Hausdorff](Hausdorff%20space.md))
* [Metrizable implies first-countable](Metrizable%20implies%20first-countable.md) (see [First countability axiom](First%20countability%20axiom.md))
