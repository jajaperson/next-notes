[Ring theory MOC](Ring%20theory%20MOC.md)

# Characteristic

The **characteristic** $\mathrm{char}(R)$ of a [rng](Rng.md) $R$ is the smallest positive integer $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the sum of $n$ copies of any $a \in R$ is $0$, i.e. $n a = 0$.
\#m/def/ring
If no such $n$ exists then $\mathrm{char}(R) = 0$.
For a [ring](Ring.md) with unity, the characteristic is the additive [group order](Group%20order.md) of unity (or zero if the order is infinite).

 > If $1$ has infinite additive order, then there is no $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\sum^{n} 1 = 0$ and thus $\mathrm{char}(R)=0$.
 > Now suppose that $1$ has additive order $n$,

\begin{align*}
\sum^n x = \sum^n 1 x = \left( \sum^n x \right)1 = 0 \cdot 1 = 0
\end{align*}
$$
