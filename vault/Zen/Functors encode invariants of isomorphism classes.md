[Functor](Functor.md)

# Functors encode invariants of isomorphism classes

Since functors take compositions to compositions and identities to identities,
they also take isomorphisms to isomorphisms,
thereby preserving [isomorphism classes](Isomorphism%20class.md). #m/thm/cat

This is a fundamental idea that captures the very essence of what makes category theory useful.
For example, in [Topology MOC](Topology%20MOC.md), the value an arbitrary functor $F : \Top \to \cat C$ assigns to *any* topological space is immediately a [Topological property](Topological%20property.md).[^br]

## Fully faithful

If a functor $F$ is [Fully faithful functor](Fully%20faithful%20functor.md) this becomes bidirectional:
$$
\begin{align*}
X \cong Y \iff FX \cong FY
\end{align*}
$$
